# Stick-Water-Fire-Game

# Overview
<br>
I'm excited to share the Stick Water Fire game, a fun and simple game I developed. It's a twist on the classic "Rock Paper Scissors," where players choose between Stick (S), Water (W), and Fire (F). Each element has its strengths and weaknesses against the others:

<br>

Stick (S) beats Water (W)
<br>
Water (W) beats Fire (F)
<br>
Fire (F) beats Stick (S)
<br>
In this game, you'll play against the computer, which makes its choice randomly. Your input is then compared against the computer's choice to determine the winner.

# How to Play
<br>
Playing the game is simple:
<br>
You make a choice (S for Stick, W for Water, or F for Fire).
<br>
The computer generates its choice randomly.
<br>
The game evaluates both choices based on the rules and declares the winner for that round.
